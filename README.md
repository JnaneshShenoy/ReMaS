Design and Interface Guidelines:
Pages: Landing/Home, Shops, Category, Product, and Admin.
Design Aesthetic: Simple, minimal, and elegant.
Color Palette: Aesthetic or monochromatic tones.
Font Preferences: Montserrat (primary), Nunito, or Calibri (secondary).
Authentication: Unified login/signup modal for both customers and shopkeepers.
Security Measures: Hashed passwords (bcrypt), session closure on browser close, and restricted access via defined routes.
Page-specific Details:

Main Page:
Navbar with logo and login/register options.
